# Architecture Decision Record

## 1. Use Architecture Decision Records
Date: 2017-03-29

### Status
Approved

### Context
We need to record architecture decisions made on this project. This was suggested after looking at [Thoughtwork's technology radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/lightweight-architecture-decision-records).

### Decision
We have adopted part of the system and have created a file to record decisions. We are not using the official ADR toolkit because we want to first make sure this technique will work.

### Consequences
All future decisions made about architecture will be recorded here.
