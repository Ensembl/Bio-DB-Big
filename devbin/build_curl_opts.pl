=head1 NAME

Bio::DB::Big::CurlOpts

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my \$timeout_value = Bio::DB::Big::CurlOpts->get_opt('CURLOPT_TIMEOUT_MS');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An autogenerated file of CURL options to be used to influence the underlying CURL library used by bigWigLib. These have been taken from the curl.h header and parsed into this Perl module.

B<DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE YOURSELF>

=head1 GENERATED ON

This module was last generated on ${date} using CURL version ${curl_version}.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 get_opt('CURLOPT_TIMEOUT_MS')

Returns the numeric value associcated with the opt in question

=head2 get_all()

Returns all available opts known to this library as a hash keyed by the opt and value is the opt value.

=cut

EOF

# Do the printing of the opts into a hash
print "my \$OPT = {
";
foreach my $opt (@keys) {
  printf("\t'%s' => %d,\n", ${opt}, $opt_hash->{$opt});
}
print "};

";

print <<'EOF';
sub get_opt {
  my ($self, $key) = @_;

=head1 AVAILABLE OPTS

Below is the list of options that are available through this module. See L<https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_setopt.html> for more information on what these options do.
